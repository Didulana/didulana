## 🚀 About Me

I believe engineering is about understanding problems deeply and designing efficient, reliable solutions.

As a Computer Engineering undergraduate, my academic focus spans both **software and hardware domains**, allowing me to develop a well-rounded engineering perspective. I’m currently strengthening my foundations while continuously learning and preparing to build impactful, real-world systems.

## 🧠 Academic Focus & Learning Areas

My degree program and personal learning are centered around:

- 💻 **Software Engineering & Programming Fundamentals**
- ⚙️ **Computer Hardware & Digital Systems**
- 🧮 **Algorithms, Data Structures & Optimization**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Data-driven Systems**
- 🧩 **Problem Solving & Engineering Thinking**

This combination allows me to approach problems holistically, from low-level hardware considerations to high-level intelligent systems.
